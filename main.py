### this function plots a visualization of the robot
### pose has to be [x,y,theta], c is the color as string (e.g. "steelblue")

    plt.plot([pose[1], pose[1] + 18*np.sin(np.deg2rad(pose[2]))], # 18 pixels is just the length of the heading direction line (no deeper meaning)

# img = map where you want to draw the scans in

    else:
            return linehigh(pose, slope, m,img)

###get the map
m = cv2.imread("Assignment_04_Grid_Map.png", 0)
###trim off the weird right side of the image
m = m[:,:678]
###and adjust it to our preferred values
m = np.ones_like(m)*255 - m

###set the pose to the following values [x,y,theta], where positive x 
###is downwards in image coordinates, positive y is to the right
###the results are output as angles in [0,360) so it is recommended to supply them in that format

###please use this pose for the scanning and for the endpoint model in task 4.2
pose = np.array([215,375,240])

###display the map and the pose
plt.imshow(m, cmap = "gray_r")
plotRobotPose(pose,'red')
plt.show()
